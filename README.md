# CraftAPIClient

## Description

This is Minecraft library for contacting the Mojang API. It features modern features of Java and flexible way of
communicating with Mojang. Furthermore, this project is used for experimenting with Unit-Tests.

## Features

* Minimal requirements to integrate it into Sponge, BungeeCord and Spigot
* Compatibility with Minecraft 1.7.10+
* Thread-Safe
* Usage of modern Java 8 features
* UUID and skin querying
* Skin changing
* Rotating multiple outgoing source IPs
* Throws exceptions to let the user decide how to handle errors
* Default in-memory cache
* Rotating proxies
* Configurable amount of name -> uuid requests before using proxies

## Planned

* Unit testing for HTTP requests like in [google-http-client](https://github.com/google/google-http-java-client)
* Service registration for Bukkit and Sponge
* Cache cracked username requests
* HTTP request interceptor to redirect to this library
* Wait a customizable interval for sending bulk requests (although this increases latency)
* Add multiple remote APIs besides Mojang:
    * [MineTools](https://api.minetools.eu/)

## Requirements

* Java 8+
* Gson (2.2.4+)
* Guava (10.0.1+)

## Contribution
